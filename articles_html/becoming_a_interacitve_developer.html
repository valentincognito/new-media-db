  When people ask me what I am doing for a living I choose the easy answer and often
  reply that I am a software engineer. Most people already have a hard time grasping the
  difference between backend and front-end development. But what an interactive
  developer might be doing leaves a lot of people puzzled. This article is not necessarily
  intended to vulgarize this universe for non-tech people but more to trigger and tickle curiosity
  to potential future developers wanting to explore new horizons.
</p>

<h2>Definition</h2>

<p>
  An interactive programmer develops and maintains interactive installations to showcase new products or
  present a company. Your work is to find and learn new ways to create fun and playful interactions
  bringing the consumer closer to a product. Your role is to create unforgettable experiences for users
  to talk about it around them. This could also be referred as branding.
</p>

<h2>Case study</h2>
<p>
  What are examples of unforgettable interactive experiences ?
  Well, for a start all the projects curated in our <a href="https://archive-media.com/" target="_blank">database</a> are all
  perfect examples of interactive installations.
  But let me break down one project in detail to show you what would have been your role in such project.
  <br>
  Let’s take the Nike Game of Go for our case study. I don't know for sure what technology they used
  but it's not the point here. The goal is for you to understand what challengers you might face working on this project.

  In the <a href="https://vimeo.com/268775888" taget="_blank">video</a> you can see multiple users competing against each
  others running on a treadmill.
  The game itself is made with a game engine like Unity3D or Unreal. (we see it’s actually Unity3D in the video)
  The players movements are captured by a motion tracking camera (probably a Kinect from Microsoft) and
  translated real time in the game. The treadmill also appears to be controlled remotely by a computer to make
  the race more or less difficult.
  <br>
  The question now is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>How do you track player movements and send it to the game engine</li>
  <li>How do you implement the network to make a multi player experience</li>
  <li>How do you broadcast the game on multiple screens at the same time</li>
  <li>How do you control the treadmill angle and speed with the computer</li>
  <li>What materials, softwares, programming languages will you use</li>
</ul>

<p>All those questions would be your responsibility if you were an interactive developer.</p>

<h2>Required skills</h2>

<p>
  You might now wonder what skills are required to become such a developer. The thing is
  that there is no perfect answer to that question. The interesting thing about working in this
  environment is that you need to be extremely versatile and willing to always learn new
  technologies. Personally I have often learned a new programming skill just for one project and
  might never use it again. However it is true that there are a few redundant technos that
  are often used for interactive installations such as: Unity3D / Unreal, Arduino, OpenFrameworks
  and mapping projections softwares. Apart from the latest all those programming environment gravitate
  around C, C# and C++. Those languages are closer to the machine and facilitate the communication with
  other devices notably through the serial port.
</p>


<h2>Opportunities</h2>

<p>
  As interesting as it might sound (or not) it can be somehow tricky to enter that field depending where you
  live. From my point of view not all companies are ready yet to spend big amounts of money for this kind
  of marketing campaign. And solutions company are not always ready to make that leap. For now, it's better
  for a business to have something else on the side such as a web development team before the interactive
  development branch becomes fully viable on its own. In any case I wish you all the luck finding a job
  that fulfills you !
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
 In this short article I hope that I picked your curiosity. I have been a developer for a few years now and
 I have never felt like I was pushing myself enough. Web development can be quite repetitive after a while.
 Interactive development is constantly evolving. Yesterday VR was a really trendy technology today it's more about
 mixed and augmented reality, but we don't know what is it gonna be tomorrow ! If you are passionate about programming
 and you can't stick to only one language or techno you should definitely give this career path a try it might become
 your dream job.
