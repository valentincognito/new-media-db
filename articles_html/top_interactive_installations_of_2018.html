  Looking back at 2018 it was a good year for AR, machine learning and data visualization. Even though the VR
  industry keeps growing with the release of several new headsets this year I haven't seen any worth sharing experiences.
  Don't get me wrong there was good VR games (beat saber ‚ù§) but no interesting interactive installations.

<h2>Augmented Reality</h2>
<p>
  Let's dive in this top picks of 2018 with the augmented reality category.
</p>

<h3>Emoji Scavenger Hunt</h3>
<p>
  Personally one of my favorite mobile app game I have seen. Combining AR and machine learning (in the browser) this app
  had everything to be a success.

<h3>Harry potter AR printer</h3>
<p>
  It's sometimes hard to demonstrate how AR can "augment" the reality but this is a very clever way to use it.

<h2>New Technology</h2>
<p>
  Every year we are on the lookout for new technologies to use in our interactive projects, we saw this year
  two new products woth mentioning in this article.
</p>

<h3>Hypervsn Hologram</h3>
<p>
  The hologram technology remains a dream for many people. It is an interesting concept though still light years behind what we
  see and imagine in our beloved sci-fi movies.

<h3>Lightform</h3>
<p>
  Lightform is a compact yet powerful tool that you mount on top of any projector and it greatly facilitate the deployement of
  mapping projection installations.

<h2>Data Visualization</h2>
<p>
  Data visualization have been around for quite some times now but it's gaining popularity again since we gained access to bigger
  and more interesting dataset with notably machine learning. The following contents requires no explanations, just enjoy the beauty
  of the visuals. A special mention to the hash2hash project that truly mix art and programmation.
</p>

<h3>Hash2hash</h3>

<h2>Original ideas</h2>
<p>Finally two projects that we couldn't assign to a specific category but that we found very clever and fun.</p>

<h3>Super Air Drone Attack</h3>
<p>North Face always come up with fun digital campaign if you haven't seen their previous videos we strongly recommend you check them out !</p>

<h3>Programmable droplets</h3>
<p>Another group of researchers and programmers good to follow is the MIT, check out their <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">media lab</a> site for more.</p>
